# Vehicule vision

A MATLAB project made by [Louis Marchal](https://github.com/piirios) and [Th√©o Vidal](https://github.com/theovidal) for ENSTA Paris engineering curricula.

## Development

Add assets into the `assets` directory :

- `assets/day-sequence` for the original sequence, i.e the one provided for school work ;
- `assets/night-sequence` is another sequence from [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmGJ4BaBvfY&t=895s&pp=ygUVbmlnaHQgYmlrZSByaWRlIHBhcmlz).

Configure the parameters in the `src/main.m` file, then run it. A figure will pop out with the results.
